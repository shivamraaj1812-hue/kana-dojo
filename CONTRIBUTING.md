- **Good first issues**: https://github.com/lingdojo/kana-dojo/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22

## 🏷️ Label Glossary (Quick)

- **good first issue**: Beginner-friendly tasks with small surface area
- **help wanted**: Maintainers would love community help here
- **community**: Issues suitable for community contribution / automation-generated
- **documentation**: Docs-only changes
- **bug**: Something is broken or incorrect
- **enhancement**: Improvement to an existing feature

### Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, see our [**Troubleshooting Guide**](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for solutions to common problems including:

- **Windows**: Firewall settings, antivirus interference, font download issues
- **macOS**: Permission errors, port conflicts

## 🧑‍💻 Making Changes

Here’s how to keep things tidy:

1. **Create a new branch** for your change:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/dark-mode-improvements
   ```

2. **Code style:**
   - We use **TypeScript** for type safety.
   - Keep components small and readable.
   - Follow Tailwind conventions and use the helper `cn()` from `lib/utils.ts`.

3. **Commit messages:**
   Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — it keeps the history neat.

   ```bash
   feat(theme): add random theme shuffle
   fix(vocab): correct typo in N5 wordlist
   docs(readme): update setup instructions
   ```

4. **Pre-commit hooks (automatic):**
   When you commit, [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) runs [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) to automatically:
   - Run **ESLint** with auto-fix on staged `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx` files
   - Run **Prettier** formatting on all staged files
   - Run **TypeScript** type-checking when TypeScript files are staged

   This ensures consistent code quality across all contributions. If the checks fail, the commit will be blocked until the issues are resolved.

   > **💡 Need to skip hooks temporarily?** Use `git commit --no-verify` (but please don't abuse this!).

5. **Run linting manually (optional, since hooks run automatically):**

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

   For the same checks CI runs, use:

   ```bash
   npm run check
   ```

6. **Test your feature manually.** Make sure all four game modes still behave correctly: Pick, Reverse-Pick, Input, Reverse-Input.

If your change affects visuals (themes, fonts, UI), take a quick screenshot or GIF for your PR. Reviewers will love you for it.

## 🌐 Translating the App

KanaDojo is available in English, Spanish, and Japanese — and we're always looking to add more languages! If you're interested in translating the app, see our [**Translation Guide**](./docs/TRANSLATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on:

- How translations are structured (namespace-based JSON files)
- How to add a new language
- Best practices for quality translations
- Tools for validating translations

## 🚀 Submitting a Pull Request

When your change is ready:

1. Push your branch to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feat/dark-mode-improvements
   ```

2. Open a pull request against the **`main`** branch of `lingdojo/kanadojo`.

3. In your PR description:
   - Explain what problem you solved and _why_ it matters.
   - Include screenshots for visual changes.
   - Add reproduction steps if it’s a bug fix.
   - Mention related issue numbers (e.g., “Fixes #123”).

We try to review PRs within a few days, but remember: this is a volunteer-driven project. If you don’t hear back quickly, a polite ping is totally fine.

If your PR isn’t accepted right away — don’t sweat it. We’ll help you refine it.

## 🧩 Reporting Issues

If you find something broken or confusing, open an issue!

Please include:

- What you were trying to do
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened (screenshots help!)
- Your browser + OS info

Before opening a new issue, check if it already exists — we might already be on it.

For feature requests, be descriptive. Tell us _why_ the feature helps learners. For example:

> “Add keyboard hotkeys for fast input during Pick mode.”

That kind of detail makes it easier to prioritize.

## 🧠 Code of Conduct

KanaDojo follows the spirit of the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). In short: be kind, be respectful, and make space for everyone to learn.

If you ever feel uncomfortable or see behavior that crosses the line, reach out privately to the maintainers through GitHub.

---

## 💬 Need Help?

If you’re stuck or just want to talk about an idea:

- Open a **GitHub Discussion** or issue.
- Drop a comment on a related PR.

We’re friendly folks — promise. 🙂

Typical response time is within a few days. We’re doing this for the love of Japanese and clean code.

---

## 🌸 A Few Final Tips

- Small PRs are easier to review than massive ones. Break things up when you can.
- Don’t worry about perfection. We’d rather have your ideas early than never.
- If something’s unclear, _ask_. That’s how we improve docs like this one.
- Be mindful that this repo is deployed on **Vercel**, so major changes may affect build times.
