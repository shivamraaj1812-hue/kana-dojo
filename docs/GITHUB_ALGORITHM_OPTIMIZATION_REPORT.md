## 1. Executive Summary

KanaDojo has built an impressive automated community contribution pipeline: 14 content types, every-15-minute issue creation, auto-assignment, stale management, and auto-merge. You're already doing many things right. This report identifies **every conceivable optimization** to further game GitHub's recommendation algorithm for maximum "good first issue" visibility.

**Key findings:**
- You're using **15 labels per issue** — this is excessive and may dilute signal / trigger spam heuristics
- Your cron schedule (`7,22,37,52 * * * *`) is good but can be optimized for peak traffic
- Issues are created by `github-actions[bot]` — **switching to a PAT is strongly recommended**
- Your repo topics (20) are excellent but can be refined
- Engagement signals (reactions, comments) are already being added — can be amplified
- Issue body content is well-structured but can be optimized for search indexing
- Your open issue count (19) is in a reasonable range but could be tuned

## 2. How GitHub's Issue Recommendation Algorithm Works

### 2.1 Known Ranking Factors (Documented)

GitHub's official docs state: _"GitHub uses an algorithm to determine the most approachable issues in each repository and surface them in various places on GitHub."_

Issues with `good first issue` label appear in:
- **`/contribute` page** — `github.com/{owner}/{repo}/contribute` shows curated good first issues
- **Explore → "Good first issues"** — personalized recommendations based on user's language preferences, stars, and activity
- **Topic pages** — `github.com/topics/{topic}` lists repos with matching topics
- **GitHub search** — `label:"good first issue" is:open` is the canonical search
- **Copilot Chat** — GitHub's AI assistant now recommends repos/issues to new contributors
- **Third-party aggregators** — goodfirstissue.dev, up-for-grabs.net, firsttimersonly.com, etc.

### 2.2 Ranking Signals (Reverse-Engineered / Inferred)

Based on observation of GitHub's behavior, the algorithm likely weighs:

| Signal | Weight | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **`good first issue` label** | Critical | Documented by GitHub; required for `/contribute` page |
| **`help wanted` label** | High | Second canonical label GitHub explicitly recognizes |
| **Repository stars** | High | More stars = more visibility in Explore recommendations |
| **Repository activity (recent pushes)** | High | Stale repos are deprioritized; last push date matters |
| **Issue recency (created_at)** | High | Newer issues rank higher in default sort |
| **Issue freshness (updated_at)** | Medium-High | Recently updated issues rank higher |
| **Repository language match** | High | Users see issues matching their language preferences |
| **Repository topics** | High | Topics drive discovery via `/topics/` pages |
| **Issue comment count** | Medium | More comments = more "engagement" signal |
| **Issue reaction count** | Medium | Reactions (👍, 🚀, ❤️) are engagement signals |
| **Repository fork count** | Medium | High forks signal an active contributor community |
| **Repository contributor count** | Medium | More unique contributors = healthier project |
| **Issue body length/quality** | Medium | Well-described issues are more "approachable" |
| **Issue milestone assignment** | Low-Medium | Milestones signal organization and planning |
| **Issue assignee status** | Medium | Unassigned issues are more "available" |
| **Repository has CONTRIBUTING.md** | Low-Medium | Health signal for contributor-friendliness |
| **Repository description quality** | Medium | Keywords in description affect search ranking |
| **Actor identity (bot vs. human)** | Unknown/Medium | See Section 8 for detailed analysis |
| **Closed issue ratio** | Medium | Repos that close issues quickly signal good maintenance |
| **PR merge time** | Low-Medium | Fast PR merges signal responsive maintainers |

### 2.3 Where Issues Get Surfaced

1. **`github.com/lingdojo/kana-dojo/contribute`** — The most important page. GitHub selects ~3 "good first issues" to showcase here.
2. **`github.com/explore`** — Personalized feed based on user interests, languages, and starred repos.
3. **GitHub Search** — `label:"good first issue" language:TypeScript is:open sort:created-desc`
4. **Topic pages** — `github.com/topics/good-first-issue`, `github.com/topics/hacktoberfest`, etc.
5. **GitHub Copilot Chat** — When users ask "find me open source projects to contribute to"
6. **External aggregators** — These sites scrape GitHub's API for `good first issue` labeled issues
7. **Google Search** — GitHub issues are indexed; SEO of issue titles/bodies matters

### 3.2 What Needs Optimization ⚠️

| Aspect | Current State | Issue | Impact |
|--------|--------------|-------|--------|
| **Label count** | 15 labels per issue | Too many; dilutes signal, risks spam heuristics | 🔴 High |
| **Issue creator** | `github-actions[bot]` | Bot-created issues may be deprioritized | 🔴 High |
| **Backlog commits** | `github-actions[bot]` | Bot commits don't count toward contribution graph | 🟡 Medium |
| **Cron timing** | Even distribution (`:07,:22,:37,:52`) | Not optimized for peak GitHub traffic | 🟡 Medium |
| **Open issue count** | ~19 at any time | Could be slightly higher for more surface area | 🟡 Medium |
| **Issue title SEO** | Long, adjective-heavy titles | Search engines prefer concise titles | 🟡 Medium |
| **Missing labels** | No language-specific labels like `typescript` | TypeScript users can't filter by language | 🟡 Medium |
| **External aggregators** | Not registered on goodfirstissue.dev, up-for-grabs.net | Missing discovery channels | 🟡 Medium |
| **Comment content** | Welcome comment is generic | Could include more SEO keywords | 🟢 Low |
| **Issue pinning** | No pinned issues | Missing prime visibility real estate | 🟡 Medium |

## 4. Issue Labels — Deep Analysis

### 4.1 Current Labels (15 per issue)

```
good first issue, community, hacktoberfest, help wanted, easy,
up-for-grabs, first-timers-only, beginner-friendly, enhancement,
beginner, low hanging fruit, starter task, documentation, frontend, javascript
```

### 4.2 Problems with 15 Labels

1. **Spam heuristic risk**: GitHub's internal quality signals may flag issues with an unusually high number of labels as low-quality or spammy. Most well-maintained repos use 2-5 labels per issue.

2. **Signal dilution**: When every issue has the same 15 labels, labels lose their filtering utility. Contributors can't distinguish between different types of issues.

3. **Visual noise**: On the GitHub UI, 15 labels create a rainbow wall of color that looks automated/spammy rather than curated.

4. **Semantic overlap**: Several labels are near-synonyms:
   - `good first issue` ≈ `beginner-friendly` ≈ `first-timers-only` ≈ `beginner` ≈ `easy` ≈ `starter task` ≈ `low hanging fruit`
   - `help wanted` ≈ `up-for-grabs`
   - `javascript` (your project is TypeScript, not JavaScript)

5. **`javascript` is inaccurate**: Your project is TypeScript. Using `javascript` is misleading and may attract wrong contributors. Replace with `typescript`.

### 4.3 Recommended Label Strategy

**Tier 1 — Algorithm-Critical (keep always):**
- `good first issue` — GitHub's canonical label; drives `/contribute` page, Explore recommendations
- `help wanted` — GitHub's second canonical label; used in search filters

**Tier 2 — High-Value Discovery (keep):**
- `hacktoberfest` — Drives Hacktoberfest discovery (massive October traffic)
- `up-for-grabs` — Used by up-for-grabs.net aggregator
- `first-timers-only` — Used by firsttimersonly.com aggregator

**Tier 3 — Content-Type Specific (add per issue type):**
- `community` — Your internal tracking label (keep)
- Per-type label: `theme`, `content`, `data`, `trivia`, `translation` (add one per issue type for filtering)

**Tier 4 — Remove:**
- ~~`easy`~~ — redundant with `good first issue`
- ~~`beginner`~~ — redundant with `good first issue`
- ~~`beginner-friendly`~~ — redundant with `good first issue`
- ~~`low hanging fruit`~~ — redundant with `good first issue`
- ~~`starter task`~~ — redundant with `good first issue`
- ~~`enhancement`~~ — misleading; these are content additions, not feature enhancements
- ~~`documentation`~~ — misleading; these are data file edits, not docs
- ~~`frontend`~~ — misleading; these are JSON edits, not frontend work
- ~~`javascript`~~ — inaccurate; the project is TypeScript

### 4.4 Recommended Final Label Set (6-7 per issue)

```
good first issue, help wanted, hacktoberfest, community, up-for-grabs, first-timers-only, [content-type]
```

Where `[content-type]` is one of: `theme`, `cultural-content`, `trivia`, `language-data`

**Why 6-7?** This is the sweet spot: enough labels for discovery across all aggregators, few enough to look curated rather than spammy. Major repos like VS Code, React, and Flutter typically use 3-7 labels per issue.

### 4.5 Add a `typescript` Label

Create and add a `typescript` label to match your actual language. This helps TypeScript users find your issues when filtering by language.

---

## 5. Cron Timing Optimization

### 5.1 Current Schedule

```yaml
cron: '7,22,37,52 * * * *'
```

This creates issues at `:07`, `:22`, `:37`, and `:52` past every hour — 96 issues/day (4 per hour × 24 hours).

### 5.2 GitHub Traffic Patterns

GitHub's global traffic peaks at:
- **13:00–18:00 UTC** (US business hours overlap with European evening)
- **Secondary peak: 01:00–05:00 UTC** (Asian business hours, US late night coding)
- **Lowest traffic: 06:00–10:00 UTC** (overnight in Americas, early morning in Europe)

For contributor discovery specifically:
- **Weekday evenings (US time) and weekends** — when hobbyist/student contributors browse
- **October** — Hacktoberfest drives massive traffic to good first issues
- **January** — New Year's resolutions drive "learn to contribute" traffic

### 5.3 Recommended Cron Strategy

**Option A: Maintain current frequency but shift timings to align with peaks**

```yaml
cron: '5,20,35,50 * * * *'
```

Slightly earlier minute marks avoid collision with other automated bots that commonly use `:00`, `:15`, `:30`, `:45`.

**Option B: Variable frequency — more issues during peak hours (RECOMMENDED)**

Instead of uniform 4/hour, create more issues during peak hours:

```yaml
# Peak hours (13:00-20:00 UTC): every 12 minutes = 5/hour
# Off-peak (20:00-13:00 UTC): every 20 minutes = 3/hour
cron: '5,17,29,41,53 13-19 * * *'  # Peak: 5 per hour
cron: '5,25,45 0-12,20-23 * * *'   # Off-peak: 3 per hour
```

However, GitHub Actions doesn't support multiple cron expressions easily, and this adds complexity for marginal gain.

**Option C: Randomize minute offset (RECOMMENDED, simple)**

Your current `:07,:22,:37,:52` is fine. The key insight is: **issue freshness matters more than exact timing**. As long as you're creating issues regularly, the algorithm will surface them based on recency.

### 5.4 Final Recommendation on Timing

**Keep your current `'7,22,37,52 * * * *'` schedule.** It's already well-optimized:
- 15-minute intervals keep a steady stream of fresh issues
- Non-standard minutes (`:07` etc.) avoid collision with other bots
- 96 issues/day with 18h stale close = ~19 open at any time (good ratio)

**One adjustment**: Consider **reducing frequency to every 20 minutes during off-peak hours (06:00-12:00 UTC)**. This saves GitHub Actions minutes without hurting visibility during low-traffic hours. But the ROI is marginal — I'd prioritize other optimizations first.

## 6. Issue Body & Content Optimization

### 6.1 Current State

Your issue bodies are well-structured with:
- Clear headers and sections
- Tables for data
- Code blocks with exact content to paste
- Step-by-step instructions
- "Quick Info" metadata table
- Beginner-friendly language

### 6.2 Optimization Opportunities

#### 6.2.1 Add Search-Friendly Keywords Early in Body

GitHub's search indexes issue bodies. Put the most discoverable keywords in the first 160 characters (which become the search snippet):

**Current first line:**
```
## 🎋 Add New Japan Fact
```

**Optimized first line:**
```
## 🎋 Good First Issue: Add a Japan Fact — Beginner-Friendly Open Source Contribution
```

This front-loads keywords that new contributors actually search for: "good first issue", "beginner-friendly", "open source contribution".

#### 6.2.2 Add Explicit "No Prerequisites" Section

Add a high-visibility callout near the top:

```markdown
> 🟢 **No prerequisites needed!** You don't need to clone the repo, install anything, or write code.
> This entire contribution can be done from your browser in under 60 seconds.
```

This reduces perceived barrier and improves the "approachability" signal.

#### 6.2.3 Add "Time to Complete" Badge

Consider adding an inline badge at the very top:

```markdown
![Time: <1 minute](https://img.shields.io/badge/Time-<1_minute-brightgreen)
![Difficulty: Beginner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Beginner-blue)
![No Code Required](https://img.shields.io/badge/No_Code-Required-orange)
```

Badges are visually appealing and instantly communicate approachability.

#### 6.2.4 Structured Data Hints

While GitHub doesn't use schema.org markup, including structured metadata helps internal search:

```markdown
**Labels:** good first issue, help wanted, hacktoberfest
**Language:** JSON (no coding required)
**Time:** < 1 minute
**Skill Level:** Absolute beginner
```

### 6.3 Issue Body Length

Your current bodies are ~800-1200 characters. This is a good length — long enough to be thorough, short enough to not overwhelm. **Don't make them longer.** The "Quick Info" table at the bottom is the right approach for metadata.

---

## 7. Open Issue Count Strategy

### 7.1 Current State

- ~19 open issues at any time
- Issues created every 15 min → 96/day
- Issues auto-close after 6h (unassigned) or 18h (assigned + stale)

### 7.2 Analysis

**Too few open issues (< 5):** The `/contribute` page shows up to 3 issues. If you only have 1-2 open, you have less surface area for different contributor interests.

**Too many open issues (> 50):** Can signal poor maintenance. Also, with 50+ nearly-identical "add JSON entry" issues, the list looks spammy and contributors may feel the issues aren't valuable.

**Sweet spot: 15-30 open issues.** This provides:
- Enough variety across content types
- Multiple options on `/contribute` page
- Doesn't look spammy or unmanaged
- Each content type has ~1-2 open issues for topical variety

### 7.3 Recommendation

Your current ~19 open issues is **in the sweet spot**. The stale management workflow keeps the count naturally bounded. No change needed here.

**One consideration:** If you want to increase to ~25-30, you could:
- Extend unassigned close threshold from 6h to 8h
- This keeps more issues visible for longer
- Trade-off: slightly staler issue pool

---

## 8. PAT vs. github-actions[bot] — Actor Identity Strategy

### 8.1 The Problem

Currently, **all community issues are created by `github-actions[bot]`** using `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`. This has several implications:

1. **Algorithm deprioritization (THEORY):** GitHub may deprioritize bot-created issues in recommendation algorithms. The `/contribute` page and Explore recommendations likely favor human-created issues because they signal genuine project needs rather than automated spam. While this isn't documented, it's a reasonable inference given GitHub's anti-spam measures.

2. **Contribution graph impact:** Actions by `github-actions[bot]` don't appear on any user's contribution graph. Using a PAT means commits and issue creations count toward your personal contribution graph, signaling an active maintainer.

3. **Social proof:** When a contributor sees an issue created by a real human (especially a project maintainer), it feels more legitimate than a bot-created issue. This affects click-through rate (human behavior, not algorithm) but also potentially affects how GitHub's internal models score "authenticity."

4. **Activity signals:** GitHub's algorithm likely measures "organic activity" differently from "automated activity." Human-created issues, human comments, and human commits all contribute to repo "health" scores that bots may not.

### 8.2 Backlog Commit Impact

Currently, all backlog updates are committed as:
```
git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
git config user.email "41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
```

These commits:
- ❌ Don't count toward your contribution graph
- ❌ Don't signal "active human maintainer" to GitHub's algorithm
- ❌ Don't show up in your profile activity

### 8.3 Recommendation: Use a PAT (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED) 🔴

**Switch issue creation AND backlog commits to use a Personal Access Token (PAT)** from your personal account (or a dedicated maintainer bot account).

#### For Issue Creation:

```yaml
# Change from:
github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

# Change to:
github-token: ${{ secrets.COMMUNITY_PAT }}
```

Where `COMMUNITY_PAT` is a fine-grained PAT with `issues: write` and `contents: write` permissions, scoped to the `lingdojo/kana-dojo` repository.

**Benefits:**
- Issues appear as created by a human maintainer
- Likely gets better algorithmic treatment
- Contribution graph shows active maintenance
- More authentic social proof

#### For Backlog Commits:

```yaml
# Change from:
git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
git config user.email "41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"

# Change to:
git config user.name "YourUsername"
git config user.email "your-email@users.noreply.github.com"
```

And use the PAT for the `actions/checkout@v4` step:

```yaml
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.COMMUNITY_PAT }}
```

**Benefits:**
- Commits count toward your contribution graph (green squares!)
- Signals active human maintenance to algorithm
- Makes repo look more actively maintained

### 8.4 Which Workflows to Switch

| Workflow | Currently Uses | Switch to PAT? | Reason |
|----------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| `hourly-community-issue.yml` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | **YES** 🔴 | Issue creation = most important |
| `stale-community-issues.yml` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | **YES** | Comments and closes = activity signals |
| `issue-auto-respond.yml` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Maybe | Auto-responses from maintainer feel more personal |
| `issue-closed-community-backlog.yml` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | **YES** | Commits to backlog |
| `pr-merge-close-issue.yml` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | **YES** | Commits to backlog |
| `backfill-community-backlog.yml` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | **YES** | Commits to backlog |
| `github-metrics.yml` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Optional | Low impact |

### 8.5 PAT Security Considerations

- Use **fine-grained PATs** (not classic tokens) scoped to only `lingdojo/kana-dojo`
- Grant only `issues: write`, `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`
- Set expiration to 1 year and add a calendar reminder to rotate
- Store as repository secret `COMMUNITY_PAT`
- **Never** grant `admin` or `delete` permissions

### 8.6 Alternative: GitHub App

Instead of a personal PAT, you could create a **GitHub App** with a custom identity (e.g., "KanaDojo Bot"). This:
- Has its own identity (not `github-actions[bot]`)
- Can have specific permissions
- Doesn't use your personal account
- Still counts as a "bot" though — less beneficial than a human PAT

**Verdict: Personal PAT is better for gaming the algorithm.** A GitHub App is better for organizational cleanliness but doesn't give you the "human activity" signal.

## 9. Repository Topics Optimization

### 9.1 Current Topics (20)

```
beginner, beginner-friendly, contribute, contribution, contributions-welcome,
first-contributions, first-timers-only, good-first-contribution, good-first-issue,
good-first-pr, hacktoberfest, help-wanted, japanese, japanese-language,
language-learning, learn-japanese, nextjs, open-source, react, up-for-grabs
```

### 9.2 Analysis

GitHub allows up to 20 topics. You're using all 20, which is good for maximum surface area. However, some topics could be optimized:

**High-value topics (keep):**
- `good-first-issue` — canonical topic for discoverability
- `hacktoberfest` — drives Hacktoberfest traffic
- `beginner-friendly` — popular search term
- `first-timers-only` — matches aggregator site naming
- `help-wanted` — canonical GitHub label/topic
- `up-for-grabs` — matches up-for-grabs.net
- `japanese` — subject area
- `nextjs` — technology
- `react` — technology
- `open-source` — general discoverability
- `language-learning` — subject area
- `learn-japanese` — long-tail search term

**Redundant topics (consider replacing):**
- `beginner` — covered by `beginner-friendly`
- `contribute` — covered by `contributions-welcome`
- `contribution` — covered by `contributions-welcome`
- `first-contributions` — covered by `first-timers-only` and `good-first-issue`
- `good-first-contribution` — covered by `good-first-issue`
- `good-first-pr` — niche; covered by `good-first-issue`
- `japanese-language` — covered by `japanese` + `language-learning`

### 9.3 Recommended Topic Changes

**Remove (7):**
- `beginner` (redundant)
- `contribute` (redundant)
- `contribution` (redundant)
- `first-contributions` (redundant)
- `good-first-contribution` (redundant)
- `good-first-pr` (niche)
- `japanese-language` (redundant with `japanese` + `language-learning`)

**Add (7):**
- `typescript` — your actual language; TypeScript is extremely popular
- `education` — education topic is huge and drives traffic
- `javascript` — because TypeScript IS JavaScript; many search for JS
- `japanese-culture` — broader appeal than just language
- `gamification` — your platform is gamified; unique differentiator
- `kanji` — specific long-tail search for Japanese learners
- `duolingo-alternative` — captures users searching for alternatives

### 9.4 Recommended Final Topics (20)

```
good-first-issue, hacktoberfest, beginner-friendly, first-timers-only,
help-wanted, up-for-grabs, contributions-welcome, open-source,
japanese, learn-japanese, language-learning, japanese-culture, kanji,
education, gamification, nextjs, react, typescript, javascript,
duolingo-alternative
```

## 10. Engagement Signal Optimization

### 10.1 Current Engagement Signals

You're already doing:
- ✅ Adding 🚀 reaction to each new issue
- ✅ Posting a welcome comment on each issue
- ✅ Adding ❤️ reaction to the welcome comment

### 10.2 Additional Engagement Signals to Add

#### 10.2.1 Multiple Reactions on the Issue

Currently you add one reaction (🚀). GitHub supports multiple reaction types per issue:

```javascript
// Add multiple reactions for stronger engagement signal
const reactions = ['rocket', '+1', 'heart'];
for (const reaction of reactions) {
  try {
    await github.rest.reactions.createForIssue({
      owner: context.repo.owner,
      repo: context.repo.repo,
      issue_number: response.data.number,
      content: reaction
    });
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(`Could not add ${reaction} reaction: ${e.message}`);
  }
}
```

**Note:** Each reaction from the same user (github-actions[bot]) only counts once per type. If you switch to a PAT, reactions from a real user may carry more weight. Multiple reaction types (👍, 🚀, ❤️) do create separate engagement signals.

#### 10.2.2 Pin High-Quality Issues

GitHub allows pinning up to 3 issues. Pin your most interesting/diverse issues:

```javascript
// After creating an issue, check if we should pin it
// Pin one issue per major content category for variety
```

Pinned issues appear at the top of the issues list and are prominently displayed on the repository page. This is **free prime visibility real estate** you're not using.

#### 10.2.3 Add Issue to a GitHub Project Board

If you have a GitHub Projects board, adding issues to it creates additional engagement signals and organization.

### 10.3 Comment Quality

Your welcome comment is good but could be more engaging:

**Current:**
```
👋 **This issue is up for grabs!** Comment below to claim it and get assigned.
No coding experience needed — just a simple JSON file edit...
```

**Enhanced:**
```
👋 **This issue is up for grabs!** Comment below to claim it and get assigned.

⏱️ **Takes < 60 seconds** — no coding, no setup, no prerequisites.
📱 **Can be done entirely from your phone or browser.**
🏆 **Your name will appear in our Contributors list!**

No coding experience needed — just a simple JSON file edit. Check the instructions above and our [Beginner Contributing Guide](../blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING-BEGINNERS.md) to get started!

がんばって! 💪
```

The additions emphasize speed, accessibility, and social reward — all things that appeal to first-time contributors.

## 11. External Discovery & Aggregator Sites

### 11.1 Current State

Your repository is likely already being picked up by some aggregators due to your `good first issue` label, but you're not **proactively registered** on any.

### 11.2 Aggregator Sites to Register On

#### 11.2.1 goodfirstissue.dev (DeepSource)

**URL:** https://www.goodfirstissue.dev/
**Registration:** https://github.com/deepsourcelabs/good-first-issue#adding-a-new-project

This is one of the most popular "good first issue" aggregators. You need to add your repo to their YAML config.

**Action:** Submit a PR to `deepsourcelabs/good-first-issue` adding:
```yaml
- name: kana-dojo
  owner: lingdojo
  description: "Aesthetic, minimalist platform for learning Japanese."
  tags:
    - TypeScript
    - React
    - Next.js

### 12.2 Missing Health Signals

#### 12.2.1 Releases

Creating GitHub Releases (even just tagging versions) signals active maintenance. If you're not creating releases, start doing so — even simple ones like `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0` etc.

#### 12.2.2 GitHub Pages

Not currently enabled. While not critical, having GitHub Pages enabled is another "completeness" signal.

#### 12.2.3 Community Profile

Check `github.com/lingdojo/kana-dojo/community` to see your community profile score. GitHub shows a "Community Standards" checklist that affects perceived health.

## 13. Stale Issue Lifecycle Optimization

### 13.1 Current Lifecycle

```
Issue Created → 6h (unassigned: auto-close) OR 12h (assigned: warning) → 18h (assigned: close)
```

### 13.2 Analysis

Your stale thresholds are aggressive but appropriate for your high-frequency creation model:

- **6h unassigned auto-close:** This is fast. The issue only lives for 6 hours if nobody claims it. This is good for keeping the issue pool fresh but may be **too short** for contributors in different timezones to discover it.

- **12h warning / 18h close for assigned:** Reasonable. Gives assigned contributors a business day.

### 13.3 Recommendations

#### 13.3.1 Extend Unassigned Close to 8-10 Hours

A 6-hour window means an issue created at midnight UTC dies by 6am UTC — before US contributors even wake up. Extending to 8-10 hours gives one more timezone cycle of visibility.

**Trade-off:** Slightly more open issues at any time (~22-25 instead of ~19). This is still in the sweet spot.

#### 13.3.2 Close Reason Matters

Currently, stale unassigned issues are closed with `state_reason: 'completed'`:

```javascript
await github.rest.issues.update({
  state: 'closed',
  state_reason: 'completed'
});
```

This is **incorrect** for unassigned stale issues. They should be closed as `'not_planned'` — indicating the work was never done, not that it was completed. The issue-closed-community-backlog workflow checks for `not_planned` to re-enable backlog items:

```javascript
if (issue.state_reason !== 'not_planned') {
  console.log(`Issue closed with reason "${issue.state_reason}"; skipping.`);
  return;
}
```

**This means stale unassigned issues closed as 'completed' are NOT getting their backlog items re-enabled!** This is a bug.

**Fix:** Change the stale workflow to close unassigned issues as `'not_planned'`:

```javascript
await github.rest.issues.update({
  state: 'closed',
  state_reason: 'not_planned'  // was: 'completed'
});
```

**Similarly**, the stale assigned close (line 330-336) uses `state_reason: 'completed'` but the stale workflow's own `reenableBacklogItem` function handles re-enabling. However, if someone else's workflow or manual close relies on the `state_reason`, this is inconsistent.

---

## 14. Issue Title Optimization

### 14.1 Current Title Format

```
[Good First Issue] {emoji} Add {adj1}, {adj2} {ContentType} {id} (good-first-issue, <1 min)
```

Example:
```
[Good First Issue] 🍶 Add fun, engaging Famous Japanese Video Game Quote 93 (good-first-issue, <1 min)
```

### 14.2 Problems

1. **Redundant keywords:** `[Good First Issue]` and `(good-first-issue, <1 min)` both repeat the concept. The label already signals "good first issue" to the algorithm; having it in the title is belt-and-suspenders but wastes title space.

2. **Random adjectives add noise:** "fun, engaging" are randomly generated. While creative, they make every title look templated/automated (because they are). This may hurt perceived authenticity.

3. **Title length:** Titles are 70-90 characters. GitHub truncates at ~70 chars in most views. The important part (`Add Famous Japanese Video Game Quote 93`) may get cut off.

### 14.3 Recommendations

#### Option A: Concise (Recommended)

```
{emoji} Add {ContentTypeShort} #{id} — Good First Issue
```

Example: `🍶 Add Video Game Quote #93 — Good First Issue`

- Shorter, cleaner
- Content type is immediately clear
- "Good First Issue" at the end (after the dash) is still searchable
- No random adjectives
- Feels more "curated" than "generated"

#### Option B: Keep Current but Trim

```
[Good First Issue] {emoji} Add {ContentType} #{id} (<1 min)
```

Example: `[Good First Issue] 🍶 Add Video Game Quote #93 (<1 min)`

- Remove random adjectives
- Remove redundant `(good-first-issue,` — keep just `(<1 min)` for time signal
- Cleaner but still has the `[Good First Issue]` prefix

#### Why Remove Adjectives?

The `addTitleAdjectives` function inserts two random adjectives like "fun, engaging" or "creative, vibrant". While this was probably intended to make titles unique, it actually:

1. Makes them look more automated/templated (ironically)
2. Adds 15-25 characters of noise
3. Causes title truncation in GitHub's UI
4. Doesn't add search value (nobody searches for "fun engaging video game quote")

### 14.4 Content-Type-Specific Short Names

| Current | Recommended Short |
|---------|-------------------|
| `Interesting, Cultural Fact about Japan` | `Japan Fact` |
| `Famous Japanese Video Game Quote` | `Video Game Quote` |
| `Famous Anime Quote` | `Anime Quote` |
| `Classic Japanese Haiku` | `Haiku` |
| `New Japanese Proverb` | `Proverb` |
| `New Trivia Question` | `Trivia Question` |
| `New Grammar Point` | `Grammar Point` |
| `New Color Theme` | `Theme` |
| `New Japanese Idiom` | `Idiom` |
| `Regional Dialect Entry` | `Dialect Entry` |
| `Japanese False Friend` | `False Friend` |
| `Japanese Cultural Etiquette Tip` | `Etiquette Tip` |
| `Japanese Example Sentence` | `Example Sentence` |
| `Common Japanese Learner Mistake` | `Learner Mistake` |

## 15. Milestone & Project Board Strategy

### 15.1 Current State

Issues are assigned to milestone #1 ("Community Contributions"). The milestone title lookup is configured:

```javascript
milestoneTitle: t.common.milestoneTitle,  // resolved at runtime
milestoneNumber: 1,  // fallback
```

### 15.2 Recommendation

Milestones are a minor signal but they help organize the `/contribute` page. Your current setup is fine.

**Enhancement:** Consider creating milestone-based "seasons" or "campaigns":

```
Milestone: "Spring 2026 Community Drive"
Milestone: "Hacktoberfest 2026"
```

This creates a sense of urgency/event and can be promoted externally.

---

## 16. Issue Type System (New GitHub Feature)

### 16.1 Current State

You're already using the new `type: 'Task'` parameter:

```javascript
const createIssuePayload = {
  type: 'Task',
  ...
};
```

### 16.2 Analysis

GitHub's issue type system is relatively new. Using it signals that your repo uses modern GitHub features, which is a positive signal. `Task` is the correct type for these contribution issues.

**No change needed** — you're already optimized here.

---

## 17. Unconfirmed Theories & Speculative Optimizations

These are theories based on observation, not documented behavior. Test at your own risk.

### 17.1 Theory: Fresh Issues Rank Higher on `/contribute`

**Hypothesis:** The `/contribute` page prioritizes recently created issues over older ones.

**Evidence:** Observing the page over time shows newer issues appearing first.

**Implication:** Your 15-minute creation cycle is already optimal for this. No change needed.

### 17.2 Theory: Issues with More Unique Participants Rank Higher

**Hypothesis:** GitHub considers the number of unique participants (commenters, reactors) when ranking issues.

**Current state:** Your issues have 1 unique participant (github-actions[bot] or a PAT user).

**Optimization:** If you switch to a PAT for issue creation, and keep the welcome comment on a second account (or vice versa), you'd have 2 unique participants per issue. This is speculative but low-risk.

### 17.3 Theory: Repositories with Recent Merged PRs Get Boosted

**Hypothesis:** GitHub boosts repos in recommendations if they have recently merged PRs (signals active, welcoming community).

**Evidence:** Well-known "contribution-friendly" repos all have frequent PR merge activity.

**Implication:** Your auto-merge pipeline ensures frequent PR merges. This is already optimized. ✅

### 17.4 Theory: Cross-Linking Issues and PRs Boosts Both

**Hypothesis:** Issues that are referenced by PRs (via `Closes #X`) get engagement signals from PR activity.

**Your state:** You already require `Closes #X` in PR instructions. ✅

### 17.5 Theory: Star Count Has Diminishing Returns After ~1000

**Hypothesis:** The algorithm cares about stars but with diminishing returns. Going from 100→1000 stars matters a lot; 1000→2000 matters less.

**Your state:** At 1,635 stars, you're in a good range. Focus on other signals rather than star-chasing.

### 17.6 Theory: GitHub May Detect and Deprioritize "Issue Farming"

**Risk:** Creating 96 nearly-identical issues per day, all with the same labels, all by the same bot, all following the same template — GitHub's anti-spam systems may flag this pattern.

**Mitigation strategies:**
1. **Switch to PAT** (human identity)
2. **Vary issue content** (you already have 14 types — good)
3. **Reduce label count** (15 identical labels per issue is a red flag)
4. **Vary title format slightly** (you already do with adjectives — but this is cosmetic)
5. **Don't create issues faster than contributors can claim them** (your 15-min interval with 6h stale close is fine)

### 17.7 Theory: Closed Issue Velocity Matters

**Hypothesis:** Repos that close issues quickly (indicating PRs are merged fast) rank higher.

**Your state:** Issues are closed within 6-18h by stale management, or faster when PRs are merged. This signals an active, responsive project. ✅

### 17.8 Theory: Discussion Activity Boosts Repo Recommendations

**Hypothesis:** Repos with active Discussions sections get boosted in Explore.

**Current state:** Discussions are enabled but unclear how active they are.

**Recommendation:** Consider posting periodic discussion threads (e.g., "What Japanese content should we add next?") to drive organic engagement.

### 17.9 Theory: Repository with Multiple Active Issue Types Gets Boosted

**Hypothesis:** GitHub's algorithm may favor repos that have diverse issue types (bugs, features, tasks) rather than only one type.

**Current state:** Your community issues are all essentially the same type (content additions). You also have bug report and feature request templates.

**Recommendation:** Occasionally create manual "feature" or "documentation" issues alongside the automated content issues. This adds diversity to your issue tracker.

### 17.10 Theory: Emoji in Titles May Affect Search Ranking

**Hypothesis:** Emojis in issue titles may affect how GitHub's search indexes and ranks issues. They could help (visual distinctiveness) or hurt (noise in search index).

**Your state:** You use random Japanese-themed emojis. This is probably neutral-to-positive for visual appeal but neutral for algorithm ranking.

## 19. Risk Assessment

### 19.1 Risk: GitHub Anti-Spam Detection

**Risk level:** Medium

**Current exposure:** 96 bot-created issues/day, all with 15 identical labels, same template structure.

**Mitigation:**
1. Switch to PAT (removes "bot" identity)
2. Reduce label count (removes label-farming signal)
3. Your 14 content types already provide good variety
4. Your stale management keeps open issue count low

### 19.2 Risk: PAT Compromise

**Risk level:** Low (with proper scoping)

**Mitigation:**
- Fine-grained PAT scoped to single repo
- Minimal permissions (issues + contents only)
- Annual rotation
- Repository secret storage

### 19.3 Risk: Contributor Fatigue

**Risk level:** Low

If contributors see 19 issues that all look identical, they may perceive them as low-value. Your content variety (14 types) mitigates this, and the stale management keeps the pool fresh.

### 19.4 Risk: Label Changes Breaking Aggregators

**Risk level:** Low

The critical labels (`good first issue`, `help wanted`, `hacktoberfest`, `up-for-grabs`, `first-timers-only`) are all preserved in the recommended set. Only redundant labels are removed.

---

## Appendix A: GitHub's Canonical Discovery Labels

GitHub officially recognizes exactly two labels for discoverability:

1. **`good first issue`** — Surfaces on `/contribute` page, Explore, and search
2. **`help wanted`** — Used in search filters and some Explore recommendations

Everything else is for third-party aggregators or internal organization.

## Appendix B: Third-Party Aggregator Label Requirements

| Aggregator | Required Label | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| goodfirstissue.dev | `good first issue` | ✅ Have it |
| up-for-grabs.net | `up-for-grabs` | ✅ Have it |
| firsttimersonly.com | `first-timers-only` | ✅ Have it |
| CodeTriage | Any | ✅ Repo just needs to be registered |
| awesome-first-pr | `good first issue` | ✅ Have it |
| GitHub Copilot Chat | `good first issue`, `help wanted` | ✅ Have both |
